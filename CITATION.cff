title: 'pycoupler: dynamic model coupling of LPJmL'
version: 1.5.29
date-released: '2025-09-22'
abstract: An LPJmL-Python interface for operating LPJmL in a Python environment
  and coupling it with Python models, programmes or simple programming scripts.
  pycoupler was written with the aim of establishing the coupling of copan:CORE
  with LPJmL. Coupling with LPJmL is possible on an annual basis, i.e. for each
  year in which LPJmL is in coupling mode, the desired inputs must be passed via
  pycoupler. LPJmL simulates the corresponding year and returns the desired
  outputs at the end of the year. The coupled programme can use the output data
  to generate new inputs for the next year.
